# EDI-Internship-2024
Code I wrote for my summer internship at the Institute of Electronics and Computer Science/Elektronikas un Datorzinātņu Institūts (EDI) in Riga, Latvia. This project focused on applying automated image analysis software and neural networks to better interpret satellite images of Latvia's forests.
