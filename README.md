# EDI-Internship-2024
Code I wrote for my summer internship at the Institute of Electronics and Computer Science/Elektronikas un Datorzinātņu Institūts (EDI) in Riga, Latvia. This project focused on applying automated image analysis software and neural networks to better interpret satellite images of Latvia's forests.

### File Structure
1. `EDI_spectral_mixture_analysis.ipynb` <br />
Spectral mixture analysis algorithm for determining the percentage of forest cover vs. open soil/asphalt in a particular land area of Latvia. Data from the ESO Sentinel-2 mission was used in the red and near infrared frequency bands.
2. `UNet.ipynb` <br />
Convolutional neural network for recognizing percent forest cover in Latvia. Data from the ESO Sentininel-2 mission in the red, green, blue, and near infrared bands was used.
